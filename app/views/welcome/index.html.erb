  <h2 class="welcome">Welcome!</h2>
  <p class="welcome_text">
    I am a second year mathematics student at University of Waterloo.
    This website was a plain HTML website (July - August 2018), and now
    it is built with Ruby on Rails. <br/>
    The reason is that I was working as a Ruby on Rails developer in
    August 2018, which gives me some experience; I would like to enhance
    my RoR skills by building this website. <br/><br/>

    To be added for this website: React, Material-UI
